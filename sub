1
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,333
There are 20 refugees
in the first transport.

2
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,291
Only girls.

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You could keep one.

4
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,333
You came to the wrong address.

5
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,666
But it's good business.

6
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,083
Some are barely 12 years old.

7
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,958
It's a big deal.

8
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,000
You just have to help
us bring them here.

9
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,208
My family does not
deal with such matters.

10
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,833
I don't have to get involved.

11
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,416
You are wasting my time.

12
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,416
Excuse me. I didn't mean to offend you.

13
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,250
Please think about it.

14
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,833
We will light a large plot for you.

15
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,375
Mario.

16
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:14,000
Fucking nicks.

17
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,041
Nevertheless, he is a potential partner.
You have to respect him.

18
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,166
Even if it's an idiot.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What were you looking at?

20
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,916
Oh, son, you have to be careful.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,416
Beautiful women are a paradise for
the eyes, but hell for the soul.

22
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,791
And purgatory for the wallet.

23
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,750
Listen.

24
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,875
It's time to stop thinking about
entertainment and pleasure.

25
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,625
You must take responsibility.

26
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,500
The day will come

27
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,875
when all this will be yours.

28
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,208
We are really sorry,

29
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,416
but only 12% of your family's
assets were recovered.

30
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,875
For the future we recommend

31
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:56,375
portfolio diversification.

32
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,875
Do you recommend?

33
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,916
You also strongly recommended
this investment to us.

34
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,250
- Good evening. - Good evening.

35
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:13,208
Will anyone tell me what
happened here yesterday?

36
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,708
I expect a refund
with 5% interest.

37
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,833
- It's impossible...
- Refund and 10% interest.

38
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,041
To the end of the month.

39
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,041
My question is:

40
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,833
how the fuck did it come about?!

41
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,666
You have to ask Mrs. Biel.

42
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,708
Please forgive the language,
but eggs are needed for this job.

43
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,625
This is the end of the conversation.

44
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,625
This is America.

45
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,416
Mrs. Biel?

46
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,458
- First of all, it's not my fault...
- Listen...

47
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,541
I have not finished yet.

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,416
I am not from taming
aggressive clients.

49
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,291
You should explain to us

50
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:09,916
why there were only two
bodyguards in the whole building.

51
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:15,916
You gave my family a word.

52
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,958
What is it?

53
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,000
You have such fun in
America: trick or treat.

54
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:30,375
I consciously received
this team at the hotel.

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thanks to yesterday's incident,
media from US to Japan showed us.

56
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,041
I thought about
sexual preferences

57
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,750
nothing will surprise me.

58
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:50,208
But what would your
loving husband say?

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Your children, shareholders?

60
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,708
Should I keep talking?

61
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,916
You made us laugh in
front of the world.

62
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,916
We know how the media and the stock
market will react when it is made public.

63
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,625
We have full occupancy for
the next four weekends.

64
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,083
After a week, the bank's shares
will lose half their value.

65
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,208
It is thanks to my strategy.

66
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,375
Age and gender had nothing to do with it.

67
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,958
I will buy a bank for a month in a
month, just for that...

68
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,833
to fire you.

69
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,875
To my office now.

70
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,416
What about my money?

71
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,083
I'm wet.

72
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,166
I am waiting for my punishment.

73
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,791
I will kill them.

74
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,208
What happened?

75
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Someone has intercepted
our cocaine container.

76
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:47,041
<i>Flight number 219 from Milan
landed 30 minutes late.</i>

77
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,166
Wait a minute.

78
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,125
Today is the birthday...

79
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,333
my girlfriend Laura.

80
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,916
I am asking you for help.

81
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,541
Yes?

82
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,958
<i>One hundred years</i>

83
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,791
<i>One hundred years</i>

84
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,083
Thank you.

85
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,250
<i>Long live us</i>

86
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,291
<i>Long live it live for us</i>

87
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,916
Thank you.

88
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,541
Are you lost, baby?

89
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,166
Thank you.

90
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,125
Thank you.

91
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,875
Good evening.

92
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,791
Are you lost, baby?

93
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,750
It's you.

94
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,750
Possij.

95
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,083
You did not respond well to the hypnotic.

96
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,000
I didn't know you
had heart trouble.

97
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,083
Suck it yourself.

98
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,000
Who the fuck are you And
why are you keeping me here?

99
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,458
- Reply. "Sit down,
I don't want you to faint."

100
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,875
- Sit down.
- I'm not your property.

101
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,291
Sit down, damn it.

102
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,208
Want to know why you're here?

103
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,083
You should have a drink.

104
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,375
What I will tell you is so amazing...

105
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,958
that until the day I
saw you at the airport,

106
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:51,250
<i>I thought that imagination
was playing tricks on me.</i>

107
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,500
<i>Five years ago my
whole life changed.</i>

108
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,625
<i>My father is dead</i>

109
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,875
<i>before my eyes.</i>

110
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:13,333
<i>A bullet pierced his heart and hit me.</i>

111
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,041
<i>I thought I would die too.</i>

112
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,916
<i>My heart stopped and I saw you.</i>

113
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,500
<i>This picture stood
before my eyes every day.</i>

114
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,208
I was looking for you all over the world.

115
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:45,500
Somewhere in me there was certainty

116
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,708
that someday I'll find you and be mine

117
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,583
Are you kidding me.

118
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,833
I am nobody's property.

119
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,291
You can't just kidnap
me and think I'm yours.

120
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I know.

121
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:10,166
That's why I'll give you a
chance to make you love me.

122
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,000
Not from coercion,

123
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,375
but of his own will.

124
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:20,666
I have a guy who will look for me.
I have family and friends.

125
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,458
I have my life.

126
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,833
I don't need a chance
for love from you.

127
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,583
So please kindly:
let me out of here.

128
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,916
The boy doesn't deserve you.

129
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,666
I told you to take your
things from the room.

130
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,083
My people left a note to Martin.

131
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,166
You wrote that you come back to
Poland and break up with him.

132
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,125
You disappear from his life.

133
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:15,250
You know what?

134
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Fuck off.

135
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,791
I will do nothing without your consent.

136
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:42,500
I will wait until you desire
me and come to me yourself.

137
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:47,541
I will not tie you, but do not provoke me.

138
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,041
I can't be gentle.

139
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,416
I do not tolerate disobedience.

140
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,833
You have 365 days.

141
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,166
I will do everything to make you love me.

142
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,746
If you don't change your mind next year,
on your birthday, I will release you.

143
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,458
Put the weapon down.

144
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,583
Or the jokes are over.

145
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,500
Do you really want to kill me?

146
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,791
Many have tried. It's not so simple.

147
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,583
Excuse me.

148
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,000
The parcel has arrived.

149
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,583
You must sign.

150
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:04,041
Take her to the room.

151
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:13,833
Let's go.

152
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,708
Massimo, there will be trouble.

153
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:26,750
A conflict with the Gattus
family can ruin our business.

154
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,250
- Take care of your business.
- I do it.

155
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,291
In my opinion

156
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:36,750
is to protect your family and
you, even against yourself.

157
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,125
Shoot me.

158
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,416
Collect everyone.

159
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:43,833
There is a great Massimo.

160
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,041
What do you do? Will you beat me?
Will you cut me?

161
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,500
If you had only robbed me,
it would have been no problem.

162
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,291
But you sold the girls to the brothel.

163
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,208
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

164
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,250
- We all have corpses in the closet.
- Silent.

165
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,708
You have shamed our family's name.

166
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,916
Family?

167
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,375
Values?

168
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,375
Spare me such a
talk and shoot me.

169
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:38,833
You will be erased.
There will be no trace of you.

170
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,916
Like you never existed.

171
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,666
It will be your punishment.

172
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,416
- Did you see that?
- What a carcass.

173
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,375
Whore.

174
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,791
How are you?

175
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,291
You shouldn't have seen it.

176
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:03,416
But he deserved it.

177
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,083
He hurt children.

178
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,958
He cheated and robbed his own family.
We don't forgive.

179
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:14,125
He killed himself with his actions.

180
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,791
It was the maid who changed you, not me.

181
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,750
You have people from everything.

182
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,625
This is one of the
advantages of being a boss.

183
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:41,125
Tell any butler to bring
my phone and laptop.

184
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,500
You regained strength.

185
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:50,708
You'll get the phone and
laptop at the right time.

186
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:57,125
If you need something,
Domenico will help you.

187
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:05,833
In two hours shopping. You need
to buy some things before leaving.

188
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:09,333
Going to where? What are you talking about?

189
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,791
I won't go anywhere except to Poland.

190
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,125
This was not an offer.

191
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:18,416
- That's an order. - Listen.

192
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,125
I'm not a sack of potatoes,
so you can throw me where it suits you.

193
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,458
If you think that I will fall in love
with you, then you are fucking wrong.

194
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:40,791
- If you hit me again...
- So what? You will kill me?

195
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:51,125
Do you have such a temperament
and you are not Italian?

196
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,458
How many Polish girls do you know?

197
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,583
One is enough for me.

198
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,666
It will be a good year.

199
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:07,875
I have to dodge faster because
I'm losing my vigilance with you.

200
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,791
Domenico brought your things.

201
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,875
You took a lot of
shoes for five days.

202
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,333
Breakfast is waiting.

203
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:52,500
I will do what I can to help you.

204
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,583
I think your boss wants me to gain weight.

205
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,416
He just cares about you.

206
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,500
You are here to do what I ask.

207
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:08,583
So please,
sit down and help me eat it.

208
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Well.

209
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,416
I have to do today.

210
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,250
Will you accompany me?

211
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,458
I said I wasn't going anywhere.

212
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,333
Etna, also known as Mongibello,

213
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,916
"Beautiful mountain".

214
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:51,416
According to legend,
Zeus imprisoned Typhon there,

215
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:56,625
a monster with a hundred heads who
is still trying to get out of there.

216
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,166
So 365 days were not enough for
Typhon to fall in love with Zeus.

217
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:02,041
- Get out of here. - Or what?

218
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:20,708
Because you'll never see it again.

219
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,458
I chose it...

220
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:34,041
and I will decide when I will watch it.

221
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,625
Watch it on yourself.

222
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,958
Wait.

223
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,375
Please help me.

224
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:15,166
I have been kidnapped.
Will gentlemen help me?

225
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:18,458
Good morning sir.

226
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:29,833
Are you lost, baby?

227
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,333
If you want to run, put on other shoes.

228
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,166
Sometimes it makes no sense to resist.

229
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:50,375
You must accept the situation.

230
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,208
The sooner the better for you.

231
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:58,416
You can either upset
this year for both of us,

232
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:03,208
or take part in an adventure
that fate has given you.

233
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,583
Not fate

234
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,708
only you.

235
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:09,875
Sometimes you have to help happiness.

236
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,875
It's true what you said

237
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,750
What?

238
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,291
That you won't touch me without my consent?

239
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,708
I'm not the monster
you think I am.

240
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:37,000
I want to recover my phone and laptop.

241
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,833
And normal food.

242
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:28,583
- You look... - I'm starving.

243
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:47,000
As you asked for - dumplings.

244
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,375
Good?

245
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,375
My grandma is doing better.

246
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,291
But you don't have to kill him.

247
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,166
I will give him a few lessons.

248
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,125
What do you do?

249
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,125
WHY ARE YOU NOT REPLYING?
I WILL NOT GIVE UP!

250
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:28,583
I deal with... business.

251
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,000
Massimo, I'm asking seriously.

252
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:37,000
You want me to wait a year.

253
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:41,333
- I should know what I'm writing for.
- You know what you have to do.

254
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,875
I have several companies.

255
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,583
Hotels, clubs, restaurants.

256
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,458
It's like a corporation
and I'm the president.

257
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,916
The whole is part of a larger activity,

258
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,041
but detailed knowledge would be
superfluous... and dangerous.

259
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,541
After my father's death,
I became the head of the family.

260
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:15,791
I didn't dream about
it, but I had no choice.

261
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,916
Same as me.

262
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,083
I wouldn't come to Sicily alone.

263
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:28,041
You will change your mind.

264
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:33,750
You just have to help me a little bit.

265
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,375
Help?

266
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:58,791
I would like,

267
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,666
to teach me

268
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,416
how to be delicate

269
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,208
to you.

270
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,166
We're leaving today.

271
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:05,166
We will be guests at several events.

272
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,625
Take this into account when packing.

273
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:16,875
Do you want something
from me or just looking?

274
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,041
Why did you look at him?

275
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,083
Do you want to touch him?

276
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,458
Little,

277
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,791
when all your life you
take everything by force,

278
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,166
it's hard to react differently

279
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,708
especially when someone takes
away the pleasure you desire.

280
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,541
Do not provoke me.

281
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:37,583
Or what?

282
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,500
Has character.

283
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:18,333
- At least I won't be bored.
- Good luck!

284
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:24,041
It's time for us.

285
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,083
Comfortably?

286
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:39,833
Speak english.

287
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,750
You must deserve pleasure.

288
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:48,833
The problem is that
after the election...

289
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:54,000
everything can fall apart.

290
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,541
Just pay them more.

291
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:04,541
You found her. And what is she like?

292
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:07,541
Glad?

293
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:12,583
As with everything, it's hard.

294
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,250
As always.

295
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,583
Are you talking about me

296
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,458
I just told your cousin that
you are a wonderful woman.

297
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:33,958
Yes.

298
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:40,083
Can you stop

299
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,833
I'm bored.

300
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,375
- And dirty. - stop it.

301
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,166
Going to wash in a fountain?

302
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:05,916
No.

303
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,750
He will do it.

304
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,250
- No. - Will you bet?

305
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:12,875
He won't do it.

306
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,916
You couldn't use the toilet?

307
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,458
The fountain was closer.

308
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,916
Sure.

309
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:29,500
What period is it from?
Early Michelangelo or late Caravaggio?

310
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:32,625
It was a gift.

311
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:34,791
Sure.

312
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:37,625
You are not a megalomaniac.

313
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,458
Great Massimo.

314
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,416
Slayer of lions and little women.

315
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,125
Stop.

316
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:06,500
Maybe I don't want to stop.

317
00:53:22,916 --> 00:53:23,916
Take him.

318
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,333
I think in my dreams.

319
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,333
You refuse?

320
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,833
You have people from everything.

321
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:34,541
Let them do it too.

322
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:37,416
Are you sure?

323
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:00,041
Open the door. I want to go out.

324
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,083
Let me out. Open the door.

325
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,333
Open the damn door!

326
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:24,791
Sit on the bed.

327
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:19,041
I will do what I want with you.

328
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,250
I was hoping that you would do it.

329
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,416
It's a telescopic rod.

330
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,500
With every move
it spreads wider.

331
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,791
I'll show you what's missing you.

332
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:32,750
See Laura?

333
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,458
Now…

334
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:48,166
you are immobilized and you
cannot resist me anymore.

335
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,666
At the same time…

336
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:01,208
I have access to every
corner of your body.

337
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:14,208
Please…

338
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,250
Are you asking me to start?

339
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,291
I will fuck you like that

340
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:39,625
that they will hear your scream in Warsaw.

341
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,083
I am begging you.

342
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:08,833
Get dressed.

343
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:12,375
We have to be in one of
my clubs in two hours.

344
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:47,083
Listen, he will kill you first

345
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,625
and then me.

346
00:59:49,708 --> 00:59:50,791
Shall we?

347
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:09,166
We will not be alone.

348
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:12,541
A few people will join us
and we need to talk to them.

349
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:15,291
Some people, some things.

350
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,625
You'll play mafia, right?

351
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,791
This is not a fucking joke.

352
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,958
Just don't lean back.

353
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,041
Wait a minute here.

354
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,791
What are you wearing

355
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:37,500
A few of your thousands of euros.

356
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,708
- Do not provoke me. - why?

357
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,666
Are you afraid that I'm doing too well?

358
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,916
I have such a short dress. You wouldn't
have to undress me to enter me.

359
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:12,958
You'll be Mine. I guarantee it to you.

360
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:18,041
And then I will take you
when I want and when I want.

361
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:20,500
Keep dreaming.

362
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Here is the real fuck!

363
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:10,625
I will fuck you so much that
you will not be able to sit.

364
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:14,750
- Come here. - Let me go

365
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,166
Get out!

366
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:48,666
Do you know what you did?

367
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,041
I had to react.

368
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:55,666
It means war.
A war between two influential families.

369
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:01,791
The only thing you can do

370
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:03,625
send Laura back.

371
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,916
Ask Anna for forgiveness.

372
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:09,500
Get rid of this damn Polish woman.

373
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,083
What the fuck are you

374
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,416
Excuse me.

375
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:19,750
Sorry?

376
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,750
I did not think…

377
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:25,875
Yes you didn't.

378
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,708
What's happening? Did you kill him

379
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:31,833
- Not your business.
- You killed?

380
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:33,416
I shot him out.

381
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,625
I wouldn't have to do it if
you didn't stop as a whore.

382
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:42,791
So is it my fault that your
friend wanted to rape me?

383
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,916
Fuck off. Enough of this.

384
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,125
- Where is that? - Leave me.

385
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,000
Where are you going?

386
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:08,125
- Where are you going?
- Fuck you.

387
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,666
- stop it! - Do not touch me!

388
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,291
Fuck you!

389
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:15,666
Cholera.

390
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:33,041
Laura, breathe.

391
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,000
I'm glad you're alive

392
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,208
and at the same time I want to kill you.

393
01:07:06,583 --> 01:07:07,958
You saved me.

394
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,791
It's good that I was so close.

395
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:13,916
Why are you so disobedient?

396
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,083
You have to understand…

397
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,041
I won't do that anymore.

398
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:31,583
I can not loose you. I do not want to.

399
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,750
You must rest.

400
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:57,958
You're wet

401
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,375
Do not play with me.

402
01:12:09,916 --> 01:12:11,500
I want more.

403
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,041
We only slept for an hour.

404
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:16,166
Are you tired yet?

405
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,333
No.

406
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,500
Only do you have enough energy
for an evening surprise?

407
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,041
I'm afraid of your surprises.

408
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:27,875
You'll love it.

409
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,041
What is it?

410
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,041
We're going to the ball.

411
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,875
Ball?

412
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:42,000
In long evening dresses?

413
01:12:43,916 --> 01:12:47,333
You fucked up I have
nothing to wear.

414
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,750
Can i ask you to dance

415
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,625
Don Massimo asks?

416
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,708
Amazing.

417
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,041
Beautiful dance!

418
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,583
Thank you.

419
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,041
So you found her.

420
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,333
Massima's first
and only true love.

421
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,625
What do you want?

422
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,666
I expected something better.

423
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:10,875
Enough.

424
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,000
I will kill her.

425
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,750
I will take away what
you have most precious.

426
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,291
Just like you me.

427
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:34,291
So...

428
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,041
I am waiting.

429
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,875
Anna is a fairly recent story.

430
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:41,083
How fresh

431
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,666
I left her when you
landed in Sicily.

432
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:46,791
I never lied to her.

433
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:50,000
Your portraits have been hanging
around the house for years.

434
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:54,500
Nobody believed I'd ever find you.

435
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,666
She didn't believe it at all.

436
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,750
- What did she say?
- Does not matter.

437
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:01,750
I want to know.

438
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,750
She said she would kill you.

439
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,125
Laura...

440
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:15,375
I won't let anyone hurt you.

441
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,041
I'll take care of her.

442
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:20,458
I want to go now.

443
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:23,416
Now.

444
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:12,041
Domenico will take you
to the airport tomorrow.

445
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,750
You have a plane at 8.00.

446
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:17,875
What?

447
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:19,916
What plane

448
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,458
To Poland.

449
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:24,375
What are you talking about?

450
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:29,583
You wanted to visit your family.

451
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:34,750
- Yes, but...
- A flat is waiting for you in Warsaw.

452
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,833
I'll join you later.

453
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,666
I love you.

454
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,041
Forget about Anna.

455
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,500
It's a past.

456
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,666
- Could it? - Yes.

457
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:26,041
And you, dear,
are the fucking future.

458
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,416
Where is she now

459
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,958
Excuse me.

460
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:35,666
Listen?

461
01:21:44,875 --> 01:21:45,875
Stop.

462
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:47,375
What's happening?

463
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:50,500
What happened?

464
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:54,208
- Wait in Warsaw. - What?

465
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:57,458
Wait in Warsaw.

466
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:25,583
Well weak.

467
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:02,250
I don't understand what you both say

468
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:06,375
but you can see that
she wants you to go

469
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:09,750
Should I help you understand this?

470
01:31:12,458 --> 01:31:14,916
Martin, Massimo.

471
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,375
Get to know each other.

472
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,208
But you probably already know Martin.

473
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:46,166
Where have you been?

474
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:50,583
Do you have any idea
what I was going through?

475
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:56,041
You look amazing, baby.

476
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,416
"You look amazing, baby."

477
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:00,666
You damn selfish.

478
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:06,291
How could you?

479
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:40,250
What is it?

480
01:34:43,333 --> 01:34:44,333
Thread.

481
01:34:45,166 --> 01:34:46,750
I arranged it.

482
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:51,083
What's happening?

483
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:54,791
What's happening?

484
01:34:57,916 --> 01:35:01,291
I don't need 365 days.

485
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:04,583
Because…?

486
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:07,875
Because I love you.

487
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:18,625
Say it one more time.

488
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:22,625
I love you.

489
01:35:45,083 --> 01:35:46,500
Will you marry me?

490
01:35:57,833 --> 01:35:59,458
Does that mean yes?

491
01:36:04,416 --> 01:36:05,416
Yes.

492
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:16,375
No.

493
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:22,500
Will you bet

494
01:37:47,083 --> 01:37:48,416
Calm down.

495
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:50,708
Everything will be alright.

496
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:52,708
I'm calm.

497
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:59,250
Please, don't tell them
exactly what you do.

498
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:04,458
- What should I say?
- I do not know.

499
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:06,375
Think of something.

500
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:22,541
Nice to meet you.

501
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:26,250
Nice to meet you too.

502
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:29,000
- Tomasz Biel. - My pleasure.

503
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:35,666
Mom asks what you do.

504
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,625
I'm a gangster.

505
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:45,000
Seriously?
You will be the first in our family.

506
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:49,791
What are your intentions
for our daughter?

507
01:38:50,166 --> 01:38:51,625
All bad.

508
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:53,291
We need to talk seriously.

509
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:55,583
- Do you like vodka? - Sure.

510
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:27,583
Good day.

511
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:29,291
Good day.

512
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:34,875
Sorry we didn't wait,
but I have to go to Palermo.

513
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:37,166
I'm not hungry yet.

514
01:40:37,708 --> 01:40:39,000
I do not feel well.

515
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,958
- What's happening? - Thread.

516
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:46,291
Domenico will take you to the doctor.

517
01:40:46,375 --> 01:40:47,583
Sweetheart…

518
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:54,333
You said no one from Poland
could be at our wedding.

519
01:40:55,125 --> 01:40:56,333
Even my parents.

520
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:01,958
You said yourself that you don't
want them to get to know my work.

521
01:41:02,041 --> 01:41:06,583
Yes, but I would like to
have my friend by my side.

522
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:10,666
Olga knows everything about you.
I need her.

523
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:12,666
Well.

524
01:41:13,416 --> 01:41:14,750
Will be a bridesmaid.

525
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:18,250
I must go.

526
01:41:21,583 --> 01:41:23,583
- Hi, Mario. - Come back soon.

527
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:35,833
Mario, I think you don't like me.

528
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:39,958
- Not true. - I am not blind.

529
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,083
It's nothing personal.

530
01:41:42,916 --> 01:41:44,916
I don't like this situation.

531
01:41:47,375 --> 01:41:52,666
You know that you caused
a lot of confusion...

532
01:41:53,333 --> 01:41:54,750
in our family.

533
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:05,916
I'll arrange your friend's arrival.

534
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:16,666
I just hope she is
calmer than you.

535
01:42:25,833 --> 01:42:26,833
Hey.

536
01:44:06,833 --> 01:44:07,958
Girls!

537
01:44:08,583 --> 01:44:09,958
I am waiting here for you!

538
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:12,291
We're coming now!

539
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:17,583
This…

540
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:21,208
Do you know…

541
01:46:43,791 --> 01:46:45,083
What's happening?

542
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:47,583
<i>They want to kill Laura.</i>

543
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:50,625
- Are you sure? - <i>Yes.</i>

544
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:57,291
Marco, go.

545
01:46:58,708 --> 01:47:00,000
Go!

546
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:07,500
Hello Darling.

547
01:47:07,583 --> 01:47:11,083
- How much time do you need to try on?
- As much as needed.

548
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:14,625
I miss you.

549
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:16,666
Me too.

550
01:47:23,375 --> 01:47:24,416
Whore!

551
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:26,833
